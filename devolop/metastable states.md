The daughter nucleus of a radioactive parent can form a state known as isomeric state, which has half life Approximately equal to 10<sup>-12</sup>s

These are also called as isomers.

example [[Technetium 99m]]

The separation of metastable daughter from its radioactive parent is accomplished by chemical means in an radionuclide generator.

metastable nucleus always emit a conversion electron. They are not pure gamma emitters.
