It is inverse of Î²- Decay.
The nucleus gobbles up an electron for K or L cell, The electron combines with the proton which forms a neutron And Neutrino.
the mass number throughout this reaction remains same, But the atomic number is decreased by one.

The daughter nuclear are mostly unstable or metastable which lead to formation of [[gamma ray]] or conversion electron through [[internal conversion]]

Examples of electron capture Are I-125,123-I, 57-Co, 67-Ga, 111-In,
and 201-Tl.
F-18 undergoes 3% EC.
