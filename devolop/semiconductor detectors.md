Semiconductors are crystalline materials with fewer loosely bound outer shell electrons than a metallic material.
Instead of positively charged gas molecules, positive “holes” are created within the crystalline structure as a positively charged atom is left behind when an electron migrates.

Sensitive detectors as density is high.

It takes only 2 to 3 eV to “release” an electron in a semiconductor material.

The most common semiconductor material is silicon (Si), others are germanium(Ge), cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe or 
CZT), and zinc telluride (ZnTe).

At the junction of the p‐ and n‐ type semiconductors (P‐N junctions) 
the free electrons from the n‐type diffuse into the p‐type and the holes in the p‐type diffuse into the n‐type.
They leave behind positively or negatively charged fixed (non‐moveable) atoms adjacent to the junction (the boron atom, losing a hole becomes negatively charged and the phosphorus atom, losing an electron becomes positively charged).
The number of fixed positively and negatively charged atoms eventually increases to the point where their cumulative charge blocks the movement of the free electrons and holes.
This zone is called the “depletion” zone 


# *Reverse biasing and biasing*

Because of this some of the holes in the p‐type material are drawn towards the cathode and some of the electrons in the n‐type material are drawn towards the anode; the depletion region is therefore widened.


## Single photon avalanche detector (SPAD)

These are composed of layers of doped silicon arranged such that the response of the detector to a single photon is greatly enhanced. 

In this nearly current free depletion zone that the incoming photon interacts with the crystal, liberating a free electron and a positive hole

Geiger–Müller range voltage across the SPAD causes this free electron to accelerate at high speed towards the anode and releasing many electron hole pairs along and reach the silicon photomultiplier.

#### Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM)

The silicon photomultipliers have the advantage of not being affected by magnetic fields.
