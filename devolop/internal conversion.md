When instead of Gamma Radiation the energy is transferred to an orbital electron from preferably K or L Shell then it is emitted as an conversion electron.

It is most common for [[metastable states]].

Energy should be sufficient to release the electron from its binding energy excess energy is given as kinetic energy.

This is different from [[β- decay!]] , as the electron is released from the Orbital shells and not from the nucleus as in case of β- decay. Beta minus decay is released as continuous spectrum of energies Whereas internal conversion is released in discrete manner.

Conversion electrons are always absorbed in the tissue.
