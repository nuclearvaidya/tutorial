The sum of the mass of individual components of atoms is always greater than the total mass of the atom. The deficient mass is converted into energy which helps to bind it.

It is a minimum amount of energy which is required to disintegrate the atom into its individual components.

1u= 931.5 mev

When a atom emits energy it always leads to increase in binding energy.
