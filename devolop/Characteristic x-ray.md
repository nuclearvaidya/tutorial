when electrons from an outer shell, Drops into the inner cell. The difference between the [[Nuclear binding energy]] of the two cells will release a characteristic X ray.
It is characteristic for each element.
Heavy metals are most likely to release characteristic x rays.
The probability that the metal will release characteristic X rays called as fluorescent yield.

There are various methods through which a characteristic x-ray is released.
1. After [[internal conversion]]
2. By daughter nuclei after [[Electron Capture]] conversion - It is suitable for external measurement.
3. During [[ionization]]- Although ionization is involved with outer shell electrons, but it can happen with inner shell electrons When it happens with inner shell electrons, a characteristic X ray is released.
4. After [[Photoelectric effect]].
