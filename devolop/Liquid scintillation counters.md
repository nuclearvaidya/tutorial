 A sample vial with liquid scintillator and 
the radioactive sample two PM tubes connected in 
coincidence. Each PM tube receives the light photons   converts them into a pulse, which is further amplified by an amplifier.  The amplified pulses are then delivered to the coincidence circuit that contains a Pulse height analyzer for acceptance. A count is registered in the scaler if two pulses of the same height are recorded in both PM tubes simultaneously /commit

## LS solutions consist of four components:

### Organic Solvent
- The solvent must dissolve not only the scintillator material but also the radioactive sample added to it.
E.g - DIN and PXE(phenyl-xylyl-ethane) (newer agents) 
     Toluene - environmentally not suitable.

### Primary solute
absorbs energy from the solvent and emits light.
Eg- bis MS benzene, PPO, BBOT

### Secondary Solute(Waveshifter)

It is used to absorb emissions of the primary solute and reemit photons of longer wavelength, which are better matched to the PM tub.

Eg. POPOP

### Additives

Helps to refine the characteristics of the cocktail.

Solubilizers (e.g. hyamine hydroxide) are added to improve the dissolution of added samples such as blood.

#### USES
 1. Particle detection
 2. sensitive assay of blood and urine.
 3.  The β− emitters, 3H, 14C, 32P, and 35S detected.

#### Drawbacks
1. Inefficient for penetrating radiation ( because made of low z material)
2. Lower light output
3. Impaired light coupling with PMT
4. Sample preparation
5. Quenching

##### Quenching
refers to any mechanism that reduces the amount of light output from the sample.

There are  three types of quenching:
1. Chemical quenching is caused by sub￾stances that compete with the primary
fluor for absorption of energy from the
solvent but that are themselves not scintillators. E.g. Dissolved oxygen 

2. Color quenching is caused by substances
that absorb the emissions of the primary
or secondary solute. Blood, Fogged
or dirty containers

3. Dilution quenching occurs when a relatively large volume of sample is added to the scintillator solution. The effect is reducing the scintillator output efficiency.


It can be minimized by following:
1. Dissolved oxygen may be purged by ultrasound
2. Hydrogen peroxide for color bleaching
