## LS solutions consist of four components:

### Organic Solvent
- The solvent must dissolve not only the scintillator material but also the radioactive sample added to it.
E.g - DIN and PXE (newer agents) /comm

### Primary solute
absorbs energy from the solvent and emits light.
Eg- bis MS benzene, PPO

### Secondary Solute(Waveshifter)

It is used to absorb emissions of the primary solute and reemit photons of longer wavelength, which are better matched to the PM tub.

Eg. POPOP

### Additives

Helps to refine the characteristics of the cocktail.

Solubilizers (e.g. hyamine hydroxide) are added to improve the dissolution of added samples such as blood.

#### USES
 1. Particle detection
 2. sensitive assay of blood and urine.

#### Drawbacks
1. Inefficient for penetrating radiation ( because made of low z material)
2. Lower light output
3. Impaired light coupling with PMT
4. Sample preparation
5. Quenching

##### Quenching
refers to any mechanism that reduces the amount of light output from the sample.

There are  three types of quenching:
1. Chemical quenching is caused by subï¿¾stances that compete with the primary
fluor for absorption of energy from the
solvent but that are themselves not scintillators. E.g. Dissolved oxygen 

2. Color quenching is caused by substances
that absorb the emissions of the primary
or secondary solute. Blood, Fogged
or dirty containers

3. Dilution quenching occurs when a relatively large volume of sample is added to the scintillator solution. The effect is reducing the scintillator output efficiency.


It can be minimized by following:
1. Dissolved oxygen may be purged by ultrasound
2. Hydrogen peroxide for color bleaching
