 A sample vial with liquid scintillator and 
the radioactive sample two PM tubes kept in darkened chambers connected in 
coincidence. Each PM tube receives the light photons   converts them into a pulse, which is further amplified by an preamplifier.  The amplified pulses are then delivered to the coincidence circuit. A count is registered in the scaler if two pulses of the same height are recorded in both PM tubes simultaneously (within 0.03 micro seconds ). this is then sent to a summation circuit which adds the two signals, sent to a amplifier finally sent to MCA

### Container
Made of polyethylene or low-potassium content glass used to avoid the natural background of 40K.
Polyethylene vials are preferred overall and with dioxane solvents
Are stored temporarily in a darkened con￾tainer before counting(to reduce phosphorecence) 

## LS solutions consist of four components:

### Organic Solvent
- The solvent must dissolve not only the scintillator material but also the radioactive sample added to it.
- accepts the incoming radiation.
- solution has a low atomic number (Z ~ 6 to 8) and density = 1.

E.g - DIN and PXE(phenyl-xylyl-ethane) (newer agents) 
     Toluene - environmentally not suitable.

### Primary solute
absorbs energy from the solvent and emits light.
Eg- bis MS benzene, PPO, BBOT

### Secondary Solute(Waveshifter)

It is used to absorb emissions of the primary solute and reemit photons of longer wavelength, which are better matched to the PM tube.

Eg. POPOP

### Additives

Helps to refine the characteristics of the cocktail.

Solubilizers (e.g. hyamine hydroxide) are added to improve the dissolution of added samples such as blood.

#### Uses
 1. Particle detection
 2. sensitive assay of blood and urine.
 3. The β− emitters, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>32</sup>P,<sup>35</sup>S, 45Ca, 40K detected.
 4. very low energy γ rays.

#### Drawbacks
1. Inefficient for penetrating radiation ( because made of low z material)
2. Lower light output
3. 
4. Impaired light coupling with PMT
5. Sample preparation
6. scintillation solution exposed to external light produces phosphorescence(persists for hours)
7. Quenching

##### Quenching
refers to any mechanism that reduces the amount of light output from the sample.

There are  three types of quenching:

1. Chemical quenching is caused by substances that compete with the primary
fluor for absorption of energy from the solvent but that are themselves not scintillators.
E.g. Dissolved oxygen 

2. Color quenching is caused by substances that absorb the emissions of the primary or secondary solute. E.g. Blood, Fogged or dirty containers

3. Dilution quenching occurs when a relatively large volume of sample is added to the scintillator solution. The effect is reducing the scintillator output efficiency.


It can be minimized by following:
1. Dissolved oxygen may be purged by ultrasound
2. Hydrogen peroxide for color bleaching
