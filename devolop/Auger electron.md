after photoelectric effect Instead of developing characteristic X Rays the energy is passed on to an orbital electron Which is then ejected out of the shell.

this creates two vacancies of electron One by the photoelectric effect and one by the auger electron.

These two vacancies can also independently cause characteristic X Rays.

Auger electron are developed wherever there is orbital vacancy. Example- Internal conversion, electron capture, ionisation of inner shell electron.

The penetration power of auger Electron is very limited. It can be considered as a type of non penetrating radiation.
