[[gamma ray]] energy is converted into light energy which in turn is converted into electric signal and detected.

# Principle

Most commonly used crystals is NaI. It has to be activated by Thallium.

The crystal absorbs gamma ray and electrons get excited and lead to [[Compton effect]] and [[Photoelectric effect]] scattering their energy creating more excited electrons. These electrons are also called as secondary electrons.
when these electrons come to rest state they release light photons(40 photons/kev) over a relatively higher span of time.
Light photons are converted into electrons by photoemissive substance at the photocathode. Generally bialkali substances are used. Eg:-CsSb

Thallium activates the crystal and increases the wavelength of emitted photon by trapping it in between the conduction band and valence band.
Thicker crystals absorb have high sensitivity as they absorb more photons.

# Energy spectrum of a crystal
![[Pasted image 20250421233749.png|300]]
## Photopeak
 The energy at which the radioactive substance gives maximum counts.
Example - [[technetium 99]] at 140 kev.

## Compton peak
Energy of Compton electron= Energy of incident photon - Energy of scattered photon.
The energy of the scattered photon is not detected.

energy of the compton electron is seen at the left of photopeak referred to as compton peak.

## Iodine escape peak

When a incident photon interacts with crystal through the photoelectric effect, there is a formation of 28 kev x-ray due to shift of electron from L shell to K shell. this x-ray is not detected and forms a peak left of photopeak called as iodine escape peak.


## annihilation peak(not clear)

## Coincidence peak

When two photons(of same or different energies and resultant photopeaks) strike crystal at the same time , the detector detects a single event with sum of two energies.

## Backscatter peak

Some undetected electrons bounce back 180 deg from the [[lead!]] shield and get detected. a/w >200kev energies.

## Characteristic Lead XRay peak

Photoelectric effect releases [[Characteristic x-ray]] of 72kev(property of lead) which leads to a peak.


# Photomultiplier tube
it is a vacuum tube with photocathode towards crystal, joined by a transparent gel with same refractive index as crystal. the photocathode emits photoelectron when light strikes it(1 per 4 photons)
the photoelectrons strike the dynodes which are metal electrodes successively placed at higher voltages within the tube. with each dynode the number of electrons released is increased and electrons hits the photoanode creating current.

# Amplifier
The current from the photo multiplier tube is further amplified for facilitating detection and counting.
 The amplitude of the current is proportional to input current from photoanode.


# Pulse height analyzer

It measures the amplitude of the electrical signal. It is used to select Z-pulses that correspond to particular energy window.

the shape of the pulse height analysis depends upon the crystal.



# Examples of scintillation detector

1. Thyroid probe
2. Well counter
3. [[Liquid scintillation counters]] - for low energy beta particle and Alpha particles as they cannot travel considerable distance.
4. [[Dosimetry]] monitors.
