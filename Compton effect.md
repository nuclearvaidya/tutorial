It occurs when an high energy incident photon collides with an outer shell electron,  Then the photon is deflected by an angle theta And they ejected electron is called as an recoil electron.

The energy transferred does not depend upon the density, atomic number and any other properties of the material.
This effect commonly occurs with photon of moderate energies(>=250kev).

Maximum energy for the recoil electron and minimum energy for the scattering photon occurs at 180 degree angle. These both values solely depend upon the energy of incident photon. It is used in calculating pulse height spectrum.

The maximum energy which a scattering photon can have is 255.5 kev.
