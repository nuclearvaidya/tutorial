incident photon energy is totally captured by a electron and it ejects out of the orbit.
the incident photon should have energy greater than binding energy for the given shell.
![[Pasted image 20250501222517.png]]
the kinetic energy of electron is difference between energy of photon and the required binding energy.

most commonly occurs in k shell and for low atomic number elements

can lead to
1. [[Characteristic x-ray]]
2. [[Auger electron]]
3. electron interacting with the matter- [[ionization]]
